\begin{exercise} Let \(G\) be a group with two normal subgroups, \(N\) and \(H\).  Suppose that \(G = N \rtimes H\).
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Show that \(G = H \rtimes N\). 
\item Show that \(G = N \times H\).
\item Show that \(G\) is abelian if and only if \(N\) and \(H\) are abelian.
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}
